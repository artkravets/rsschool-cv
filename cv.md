## About myself:

Having started learning programming with C++ and C#, i was interested in 3D modeling. Around the same time I started making Wordpress templates, using HTML/CSS in the process. Then i became a Wordpress freelancer as self employed. Two years later, I needed to use more features in my work than Wordpress makes possible. So I decided to take a more detailed study of HTML/CSS and JavaScript. I was very impressed with the functionality of Javascript and its frameworks. I also started learning Git and Figma. My plane is to learn Lodash, Webpack builder, testing of JavaScript applications and React framework in the future. I chose a frontend developer career because I really like to make beautiful and user-friendly interfaces. And no less important, because I love JavaScript.
