## About myself:

Having started learning programming with C++ and C#, i was interested in web-development. 
Simultaneously i started making Wordpress templates, using HTML/CSS in the process. 
Then i became a Wordpress freelancer as self employed. Two years later,
I needed to use more features in my work than Wordpress makes possible.
So I decided to take a more detailed study of HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Git and Figma.
My plane is to learn Lodash, Webpack builder, testing of JavaScript applications and React framework in the future.

***

## Areas of expertise:

* Javascript
* HTML5, CSS3
* Git, npm
* Figma

***

## Code example:

**Create Phone Number KATA from Codewars:** *Write a function that accepts an array of 10 integers (between 0 and 9), that returns a string of those numbers in the form of a phone number.*

```
function createPhoneNumber(numbers){
numbers.unshift('(');
numbers.splice(4,0,')');
numbers.splice(5,0,' ');
numbers.splice(9,0,'-');

return numbers.join('');
}
```
